-MAKING YOUR OWN-
If you wish to make your own dungeon, please follow these few steps.
1 -- Read the EXAMPLE.xml I have left for you.
2 -- If you wish to add a different sound file, just add your sound file(make sure it is a '.wav' file!) and rename it 'BGMusic.wav'. This will allow for your music to play in the background.
3 -- DO NOT MISS BRACKETS, IT WILL NOT WORK.
4 -- Rename your xml to 'Dungeon.xml' and you should be done!
5 -- Don't forget: If you make your own dungeon and follow the instructions I have laid out in the EXAMPLE.xml, you should be fine.
